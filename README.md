# Python/Raspberry Pi Relay Controller (LED Photoreactor)

## Description
Android APK written in python/kivy that allows scientists to quickly and easily convert common energy units used.

## Project Status
Published on Google Play, small bug fixes will be made and potentially an IOS version will be released in the coming months.

## Installation
The live APK can be found on the Google Play store and can be installed on any android device.

On Windows or Linux computers, the python package (main.py) can be run as long as the EnergyConversions.py is found in the same directory. This will generate the GUI and allow users to work with the energy conversion tools on their PCs.

Building a modified APK from the python package requires Buildozer to be configured on a linux machine or VM.

## Usage

'''python main.py'''
